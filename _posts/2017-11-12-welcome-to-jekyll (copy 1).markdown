The assets/ folder is for files you want to output to the user?s site. For example, JavaScript, image or style files. You would normally place these files into js/, css/ or images/ folders.

awesome-jekyll-theme.gemspec is the file that describes your gem theme. Here is where you can list the name, the version, a description, a homepage, and a list of gems for your theme gem.

The Gemfile is for Bundler, which we mentioned before. This links the gems listed in your .gemspec file with Bundler in your command line tool. We?ll be using Bundler later to test out your theme.

Finally, the README.md and LICENSE.txt are there to document your theme and to provide a suitable license. You?re probably familiar with these files if you?ve created a GitHub project before.

Note: It?s important to document your theme thoroughly. That way, people who want to use your theme will be able to do so easily, and use the options and controls you?ve provided within it.
